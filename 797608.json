  "description": "After a horrible, mechanized beast begins attacking the town, all fingers begin pointing at Scooby. Before the gang can clear his name, the Sheriff has Scooby hauled away to the Crystal Cove Hospital for Criminally Insane Animals. Now, it's up to the gang to clear Scooby's good name. But standing in their way is a new enemy they hadn't counted on: a diabolical parrot named Professor Pericles, who knows more about Mystery Inc. than he should. Add to this the growing friction between Shaggy, Velma and Scooby, and you have a recipe for disaster.",
