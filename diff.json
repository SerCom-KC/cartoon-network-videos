When the sheep takes a liking to Diesel, the three engines decide to let her sleep with them in the sheds until they can find out where she came from. However, when the sheep's fluffy herd arrives for an extended sheep-over, the engines realize that their fleecy and noisy guests have overstayed their welcome. Will they be able to get the sheep back home where they came from, or will the baaa-ing sheep continue to disrupt the engines' sleep?",
