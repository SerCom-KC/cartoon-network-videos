Encountering Riff and Jiff with their usual happy-go-lucky attitudes, Thomas comes to the conclusion that he'll only be liked when he appears happy. He puts on fake smile for the rest of the day, but his words don't match his demeanor and everyone can see right through him. Finally, Thomas comes across Riff and Jiff again, who reveal they're also upset about the cruddy day! They teach him that nobody can be happy all the time, and sometimes you need a friend to vent to on the days you're most blue.",

But as he shadows them, their jobs prove to be a bit too intense for the older engine -- in fact, Toby glumly starts to believe maybe he is too old. Determined to pick up Toby's spirits, Thomas and Sandy get creative and turn an old axle into a \"superaxleatortron\" -- a 'brand-new' part to put the pep back in Toby's confidence! When the plan goes sideways because the other engines want \"super-axles\" too, Toby discovers that he never needed the special part -- he just needed to believe in himself!",
