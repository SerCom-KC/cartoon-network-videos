Percy is the only one who isn't interested in playing, so Thomas asks him to referee instead. He reluctantly agrees and the race is on! Coming to a split second finish, Percy determines Thomas' team wins, but Diesel doesn't accept and calls for a rematch. Once again the teams race and Diesel wins after accidentally causing an oil spill. Both teams become so angry with each other, they're too distracted when Percy runs off to chase butterflies. Thomas, Diesel, and friends finally notice Percy's absence and speed after him, but they'll need to learn their lesson about sportsmanship if they want to ensure this day off is a success.",

Carly and Terence manage to get everything together quickly, but soon Terence purposefully crashes into the hay bales sending loose hay all over the place! Carly is shocked and confused, and Terence explains that he can bale the hay again with his trusty baler in no time. They turn the hay-bale stacking into a game, forming all kinds of structures Terence can crash into, until they finally form the tallest hay tower ever. When Thomas finally arrives to pick up the hay, he's worried they won't have enough time to complete the delivery, but Terence reminds him that they can work and have fun all at the same time.",
