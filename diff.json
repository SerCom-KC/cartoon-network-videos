They're instructed not to peek at it until they arrive. While making the delivery, part of the balloon pops out of its tarp and the wind carries it skyward, along with Percy. Percy never expected to enjoy a flight that much! Now it's up to Thomas to get help from Harold and Beresford in order to bring Percy home.",

An observant Thomas hears the mistake, but does not correct the crankier-than-usual crane -- thinking, grown-ups don't make mistakes! Thomas is proven wrong, however, when he ends up at Whiff's Recycling Plant and old tires are delivered to McColl's Farm because of Cranky's error. After calming the chaos in both places, Thomas learns that it is important to speak up and tell someone they are making a mistake --- even if it is a grown-up!",
