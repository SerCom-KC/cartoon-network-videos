In desperation to not burn alive, Master Frown tells Unikitty a story about a younger Master Frown who was gifted a special lollipop but after a freak chain of events, was broken right before his eyes. Unikitty cries her eyes out and puts out the fires and then reveals it was her plan all along to get Master Frown to talk about his feelings!",
