            "description": "Space Cow: Cow and Chicken both win a contest that allows them to spend a day in the career of their choice.  Cow chooses to be an astronaut, and gets sent up on the space shuttle.  Chicken says he wants to go where the real money is - marketing, and becomes a bag boy at the local supermarket. The Legend of Sailcat: Flem's Dad takes Chicken, Flem and Earl on a camping trip in the woods, where they're having fun telling scary stories around the campfire.  When Cow crashes their campout (literally), the boys become upset.  So Flem's Dad distracts them by singing the scariest, creepiest story of all - The Legend of Sailcat - a musical epic about a cat who gets flattened by an 18 wheeler and goes on to become a hero of the highways. Happy Baboon Holidays:  (Weasel)  Weasel charms Baboon's family at Christmas time.  Hurt and outraged, Baboon sets out to leave booby traps for Santa on Weasel's roof.\r\n",
