Carly is shocked and confused, and Terence explains that he can bale the hay again with his trusty baler in no time. They turn the hay-bale stacking into a game, forming all kinds of structures Terence can crash into, until they finally form the tallest hay tower ever. When Thomas finally arrives to pick up the hay, he's worried they won't have enough time to complete the delivery, but Terence reminds him that they can work and have fun all at the same time.",
