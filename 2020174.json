It's Mother's Day, and Gumball and Darwin discover that Tobias and Banana Joe have both made a card for \"The Best Mom in the World\". Clearly Nicole Watterson is the Best Mom, but Tobias and BJ just won't admit it... So they organise a mom-off at the mall between Nicole, Banana Barbara and Jackie Wilson. Needless to say it gets pretty intense.",
