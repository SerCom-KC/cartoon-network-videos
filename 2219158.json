Who doesn't like a good ghost hunt, plus capturing a ghost on camera should make Awesome Brawlers' next video a huge success!/Two of a Kind: Veronica Venegas is doing a special report on the Awesome brawlers own: Lightening! The special report takes a back seat when Lightening is challenged to a brawl. Lightening uses this brawl the perfect opportunity to rollout his new Bakugan partner: Tretorous.",
