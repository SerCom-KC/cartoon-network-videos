  "description": "Yanko invites Pocoyo and friends to spend Christmas with him and they accept gladly. However, when they arrive they discover that it's not the ideal plan they had imagined. Everything is made of ice, they slip, it's very cold and the food is disappointingâ€¦ things are a bit complicated, especially for Pato, who was expecting to spend Christmas next to a chimney with a hot chocolate. But they will soon learn that, in spite of slippery ice, frozen fish and falling into the cold Artic water, the truly important thing is to spend Christmas together.",
