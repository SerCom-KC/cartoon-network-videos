The suspicion quickly turns inward, and the ABs are left wondering if they have an imposter among them!/ A kid brawler named Oliver has lost his Bakugan! This seems like a job for the Trouble Busters. The Awesome Brawlers help him chase down and try to catch the elusive Bakugan, who leads them on a wild goose chase through Los Volmos.",
