  "description": "When Dad gives Larry's hairdresser a bad review for saying he's bald, he gets offered a free haircut. This inspires Gumball and Darwin to go on a reviewing spree across town, forcing Larry to give them stuff with the threat of a bad review. Just because the customer is always right doesn't mean that what they're doing isn't wrong. ",
