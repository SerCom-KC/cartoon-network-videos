Soon there's a huge pile of rubbish, and it turns out it's on Caterpillar's doorstep. The rubbish keeps getting thrown around until finally Pocoyo follows the rubbish and realizes it's just going in a circle. In order to break the cycle, Pocoyo helps his friends make some new fun toys and games out of the rubbish.",
