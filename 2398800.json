When Thomas wins the race and the pine is loaded onto his flatcar, he discovers that he overestimated the job and himself, resulting in the tree falling in a deep ditch! Luckily, Beresford the Crane has a plan to aid the Number One Engine! Will they be able to plant the biggest tree before the end of the holiday?",
