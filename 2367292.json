  "description": "Prince Ivandoe is unsurprised to discover that he is worshipped by a group of moles. Their leader, the sinister Dark Lord of Moletown, is convinced that Ivandoe's magic potion once bestowed upon him the ability to see in the daylight. The Dark Lord now wishes for Ivandoe to use his magic on his moley minions, so that they might rise up as an unstoppable army and take over the forest! When the moles realize Ivandoe isn't actually magic, things go a little \"squiggly\".",
