  "description": "After being rudely interrupted by Bim Bom during her daily morning song, an angry Unikitty takes the advice of her friends and writes down her feelings into a letter with the intention of keeping the letter to herself, but then accidentally sends it off, complete with postage! The gang then goes on a wild chase through the Unikingdom mail delivery service to keep that rude letter from getting into the hands of Bim Bom, and ultimately hurting her feelings. Turns out, Unikitty's \"rude\" is everyone else's \"nice\" and the letter was full of compliments.",
