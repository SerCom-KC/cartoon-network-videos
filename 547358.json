The Titans try to go along with the strange ways of Starfire's homeworld. But Robin has a hard time believing Starfire really wants to marry someone she's never even met. And when he learns the Grand Ruler is none other than Blackfire, it seems like Starfire's evil sister may be up to her old tricks. Can Robin stop the wedding before it's too late?",
