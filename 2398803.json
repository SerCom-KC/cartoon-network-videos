Thomas and Diesel ask Sir Topham Hatt to hold a race where the winner's name will become the official name of the new tunnel. When both ambitious engines get stuck in the tunnel during the race, they stubbornly refuse to move... even if it risks missing the Butterfly Migration with their friends!",
