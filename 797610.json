But things don't go as planned when a creature called Char Gar Gothakon begins terrorizing the campus. Turns out, this beast is a fictional character come to life. A creation of the author H.P. Hatecraft, who is a professor at the school. Although one of the other professors, Harlan Ellison, claims Hatecraft is a fraud, the creature is definitely real. And when it attacks and carries off Hatecraft to his doom, the gang realizes it has to come together once again to solve this mystery and save Hatecraft's life.",
