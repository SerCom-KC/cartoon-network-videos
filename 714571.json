  "description": "It's the day of the Talent Show. First Elly does some ballet karate. Then it's Baby Bird's turn: he's a crazy pinball wizard. Caterpillar nervously says she'll have her go later. Whale sings down the line from underwater. Pato does some unbelievable impersonations. Pocoyo reads out a story he's written. It's Caterpillar's turn but she's too scared. She doesn't want to do her bit. She's shy. We persuade her to show us her talent. She does a talk all about hippopotami. Once she's started, there's no stopping her. It's wonderful. What a fantastic and unforgettable display of unique talents. Everyone can do something special.",
