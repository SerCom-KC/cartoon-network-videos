  "description": "Crystal Cove may be the most haunted town in the world but that doesn't stop Scooby and the gang from trying to prove that most of its most famous tourist attractions were fakes, much to the anger and dwindling profits of their parents. But when a radioactive barrel is accidentally opened releasing a hideous sewer beast that cocoons its victims in frozen yogurt, their mystery-solving skills are put to the test. After all, what could a sewer beast, a delicious edible dessert, underground caves and shrimping boats made of balloons possibly have in common? I'll give you a little hint - the local bank.",
