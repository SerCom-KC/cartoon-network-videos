  "description": "When Bulstrode excitedly announces that he is getting a brand new paint job on the Mainland, everyone is thrilled for him -- except for a crankier-than-usual Cranky. When the crane's dismissive comments upset Bulstrode, the tugboat storms off, leaving Thomas and Percy to pick up the pieces, repair their friendship, and encourage both of them to do something they have never done before -- talk about their true feelings towards each other!",
