  "description": "The Whiffles are too hot and tired to work because their daily treat, colorful ice in Waffles Cones delivered by the whimsical \"Icelings,\" hasn't arrived - the Icelings have mysteriously disappeared. As the Care Bears search for them, Share volunteers to make the treats. It's much more than she can handle but she's determined to go-it-alone and not ask for help. Things get out of hand and Share ends up snared in Bluster's trap with the Icelings, who help her to realize that we get more done when we work together.",
