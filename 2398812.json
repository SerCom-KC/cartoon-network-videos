  "description": "Thomas learns that the rocket he helped deliver is finally falling back to Earth, into the ocean outside Sodor. Bulstrode, Carly, and their team of retrieval experts are on the job to fish the rocket out of the water, and Thomas wants to help! However, Thomas is so interested in seeing the rocket again that he's too distracted to hear instructions. After a series of mishaps, Thomas learns how to genuinely pay attention, but the rocket is floating towards the drawbridge. Thomas will need to figure out how to help in the best way he knows how before the rocket is lost forever.",
