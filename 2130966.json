  "description": "Deadshot's been enlisted to put a hit on Batman but with Superman's help they thwart his plan and take him into custody. Stuck in a barren interrogation room, Superman offers to play bad cop for a change but he's such a decent guy that Deadshot just laughs at him. Batman's attempt at playing good cop though seems to make an impression on the villainous creep, and definitely not a good one.",
