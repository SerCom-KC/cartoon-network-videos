It doesn't take long for Superman, Wonder Woman, Batman and the rest of the Justice League to take notice and invite the earnest do-gooder to join the team. But to become a member, he must reveal his true identity. While fighting off the evil Mr. Mind and Black Adam, Billy learns that he must trust others - and that nothing creates trust like helping those in need.",
