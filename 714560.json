  "description": "Pocoyo, Elly and Baby Bird are bored of Pato's countless flower photos so they encourage him to take pictures of them instead. But each time Pato takes a photo, someone moves. Pato is exasperated because he wants to take perfect portraits but there's always something not quite right. Pato gives up. His friends put on an exhibition of his photos to show him that his pictures may not be exactly what he had in mind, but they really are wonderful because they capture the fun the friends have together.",
