  "description": "Sarah, the new kid in school, is Gumball and Darwin's number one, slightly obsessive, fan. Sarah is intensely following Gumball and Darwin around trying to win their friendship.  When Gumball tells her that she is acting like a stalker, she embraces it and actually takes it up a notch.  However, when Gumball and Darwin realise that she's behaving this way because she's lonely, they go to surprising lengths to make her feel accepted.",
