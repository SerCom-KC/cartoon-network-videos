  "description": "Pocoyo and Pato stumble upon a disco and Elly is the DJ. Pato gets grooving to a track and Elly thinks he's fantastic. But Pocoyo's not impressed. He has a go and shows his dance. It's wonderful, but then Pato thinks he can do even better. And so it goes on - an impromptu, ever-so-funky dance off! Things get out of hand when Pocoyo is raving and Pato is body-popping so Elly changes the record. She takes to the dance floor and shows the rivals - in an uncannily Britney-esque way - that instead of competing, they can all have fun dancing together! It's much more fun.",
