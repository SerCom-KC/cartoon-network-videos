  "description": "Pato, Pocoyo and Elly are having fun doing running and jumping competitions: except Pato is taking it very seriously. So when he loses he's mighty miffed. He is a very bad loser. He goes off in a huff and finds some swanky sneakers. He tries them on and discovers that these are no ordinary sneakers: they have a life of their own, they have super powers. Once he's mastered them he challenges Pocoyo and Elly to a re-match. Of course now he wins the running and jumping contests hands down. But Elly feels that something's up and doesn't want to compete anymore. When Pato tries to take the shoes off he realizes they won't undo. He's stuck and the shoes are going crazy. Luckily Caterpillar and Baby Bird save the day by getting the shoes off. And Pato has learnt that cheating just isn't a good way to win.",
