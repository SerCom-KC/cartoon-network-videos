  "description": "It's a windy day and Pato's hat gets blown away. Pato doesn't like the way he looks without his hat and he's afraid his friends will laugh at him so he hides and won't play. Finally they catch up with him and he tries on a selection of replacement hats, none of which quite fit the bill. When Elly and Pocoyo realize what's wrong they don't understand Pato's reaction. They like the way he looks. Pato comes to see that his friends love him for who he is, not what he looks like and the friends all play happily together.",
