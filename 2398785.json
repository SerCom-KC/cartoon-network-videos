  "description": "Carly has developed a terrible SQUEAK, and Sandy finds an oil can to give her as a feel-good surprise. But when everyone keeps telling Sandy how awful Carly's squeak actually sounds, Sandy feels motivated to keep making the fix bigger and bigger until she's created a wacky robot oil can squirter. The robot goes haywire, squirting everyone except Carly with oil. In the end, Sandy learns that the simple oil can was the only thing Carly needed all along.",
