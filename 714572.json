  "description": "Pocoyo want to show his friends a film of all his favourite memories. His friends are bored and a bit miffed when they realise they don't feature in the movie at all. So Pocoyo shows them some more favourite bits, this time featuring Elly, Pato and the others, all in embarrassing, funny, silly fixes. Pocoyo thinks it's hilarious but of course his friends are hurt. So Elly shows her favourite bits: all of her bits show her being beautiful, graceful and strong. Pato doesn't like her bits so he shows his. Again, the others get bored and unhappy. They all argue about who should show clips till Baby Bird brings along a selection of clips of everyone having fun together. Those are the best bits of all!",
