_The Care Bears are to witness the annual blooming of the Pinata Tree, an ancient event that can only happen if the Keeper of the Tree sees something that makes him giggle. Good Luck's giggle-inducing entertainment act goes awry because he relies on his errant lucky shamrock for success. He must learn to forgo luck and practice his act instead._
