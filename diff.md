_Lex Luthor plays a deadly game of "know thine enemy," baiting Superman into a remote hideout in search of a kidnapped woman named Brie Gruyere. The super hero pounds Lex through the ceiling of another building housing the victim, where the "girl" turns out to be a Kryptonite gas spewing robot. As Superman and Lex ponder aloud the predictability of a foe's actions, it looks like Lex, armed with a Kryptonite club, is winning. But he may not know his enemy as well as he thinks._

_Deadshot's been enlisted to put a hit on Batman but with Superman's help they thwart his plan and take him into custody. Stuck in a barren interrogation room, Superman offers to play bad cop for a change but he's such a decent guy that Deadshot just laughs at him. Batman's attempt at playing good cop though seems to make an impression on the villainous creep, and definitely not a good one._

_Wonder Woman explains that "bonding is important" as they unite to fight fires, explosions, and tendrils of monstrous vines that choke off the city. It's all the work of Poison Ivy and her Ivy League. Her gigantic Venus Flytrap of a vine squeezes Batman, Star Sapphire bats away Superman's attempts to catch her, Cheetah puts the Flash out of commission, and Ember makes an explosive entrance to finish him off. Wonder Woman steps in to interrupt the mayhem so the boys can get back in the game. They're all for unity, except for the Dark Knight, but the game they end up with is hardly what anyone expected._

But while she's waiting, flirty Firestorm would like nothing more than to impress her by shouting nerdy terms, coached by Prof. Martin Stein ("Keynesian economics, Hegelian dialecticism!") which makes her yawn. As she fends off HIVE's violent attack, Firestorm throws out theory after theory, but it's not helping much. Will he be able to use his own powers and dazzle her at the same time?_

_Lois Lane believes that Clark Kent is Superman, so the Man of Steel enlists Plastic Man to put the doubt back by having him pose as Clark. Lois lures "Clark" to the Daily Planet rooftop and jumps to test him, but she's rescued by, Superman!  But he's hit with red Sun radiation beamed by an armored Lex Luthor, who wants a retraction of Lois's "lies" about him in the paper. The weakened Superman is no match for Luthor in (body armor), so Plastic Man has to stretch to the occasion._

_The Joker and Batman duke it out on a Gotham City rooftop. In their between punch banter, Batman calls the Joker's jokes, "old, but never funny." The villain takes offense and drops a pair of gas bombs, then escapes the explosion with a jet pack, which gets taken down with a Batarang. He falls, spiraling right into a little kid's backyard birthday party. Now, the Joker gets to show off his comic timing with what he's always wanted, a captive audience!_
