But the gang and Mr. Sudeikis are being stalked by a horrible Snake Man Monster that seems intent upon stopping them from reaching their destination. Can our gang survive this adventure and solve this sneaker-filled mystery? Can Mr. Sudeikis truly find the very first high-top ever made?

_Scooby-Doo takes the gang to meet his good friend, Lucy Liu, at her art gallery in Queens. She has a large art studio above the gallery that she uses to paint and sculpt. She's having a big gallery opening, but when one of her large humanoid modern sculptures comes alive and attacks them, the gang and Lucy have a real mystery on their hands. It seems the monster is very interested in an old seemingly-worthless piece of wood Ms. Liu collected when she was a girl right here in Queens. It turns out that it's actually a puzzle-box and what it contains opens up a whole new layer to this mystery. Can our gang help Lucy Liu save her gallery opening and trap the monster? Or will they all be painted into a corner, permanently!_
