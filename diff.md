_The exhibits at New York's Natural History Museum come to life at night. When they start behaving strangely, Larry, newly-promoted director of nighttime operations, must find out why. The Tablet, which magically brings the creatures to life, has started to decay and the only method of restoring is available at the British Museum. In order to save his museum family, Larry, his son Nick and the museum exhibits travel from New York to London, to discover the Tablet's secret._
