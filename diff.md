_After getting through a rough night's sleep and finding out his beach day gets cancelled due to the rain, Thomas winds up in the grumpiest of moods. Encountering Riff and Jiff with their usual happy-go-lucky attitudes, Thomas comes to the conclusion that he'll only be liked when he appears happy. He puts on fake smile for the rest of the day, but his words don't match his demeanor and everyone can see right through him. Finally, Thomas comes across Riff and Jiff again, who reveal they're also upset about the cruddy day! They teach him that nobody can be happy all the time, and sometimes you need a friend to vent to on the days you're most blue._

_With Thomas in a rush to get a ton of hay bales delivered to the mainland by the end of the day, he tasks Terence the Tractor and Carly to assemble all the bales in his stead. Carly and Terence manage to get everything together quickly, but soon Terence purposefully crashes into the hay bales sending loose hay all over the place! Carly is shocked and confused, and Terence explains that he can bale the hay again with his trusty baler in no time. They turn the hay-bale stacking into a game, forming all kinds of structures Terence can crash into, until they finally form the tallest hay tower ever. When Thomas finally arrives to pick up the hay, he's worried they won't have enough time to complete the delivery, but Terence reminds him that they can work and have fun all at the same time._
