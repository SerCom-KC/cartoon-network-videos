_Unikitty hosts a live music video countdown show for the kingdom, presenting the ecstatic audience with the top 4 music videos in the Unikingdom, featuring our favorite characters. Unikitty & Hawkodile team up for a death-metal picnic battle video, Dr Fox sings an 80s synth-pop jam about creating the perfect dance partner with science, Puppycorn sings a ridiculous nonsense song about his perfect day, and Richard unexpectedly closes the show out with the best song in the kingdom, a blistering hair-metal rock ballad with lots of solos and passionate dancing._
