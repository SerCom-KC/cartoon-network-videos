  "description": "Scooby Doo and the gang are investigating mysterious ghost sightings at an old haunted prison that's been abandoned and derelict for over a hundred years. The Cheever State Penitentiary outside Cleveland, Ohio, has been closed since the 1930s, but it's said to be one of the most haunted places on earth. On the trail of a scary ghost, our gang accidentally bumps into none other than Morgan Freeman who's here making a documentary about the place. When the ghost attacks, our gang and Mr. Freeman team up to solve this mystery. All the while, Mr. Freeman does a documentary with narration regarding our gang and how they solve the mystery in something of a combination \"Nature Documentary,\" \"True Crime\" and our mystery solving gang in their natural habitat.",
