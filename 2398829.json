  "description": "It's a beautiful summer day on Sodor and Sir Topham Hatt has a surprise: a special plaque with a map of the island atop Lookout Mountain! Sir Topham Hatt recruits the engines to lead \"The Sight of Sodor\" tour: to the plaque and back, missing all of the real tourist attractions! The engines are not enthusiastic about Sir Topham Hatt's attraction -- and neither are the island's visitors! As less and less passengers board Annie and Clarabel to see the plaque, Thomas and the gang decide to take matters into their own wheels and show off their favorite places on Sodor -- resulting in a lot more fun in the sun!",
