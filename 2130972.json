  "description": "Under heavy ground fire, Batman, Wonder Woman, Plastic Man, and Cyborg search for the HIVE headquarters from their aircraft. But HIVE has cloaked its entire operation. The team splits, with Wonder Woman in Justice II and the others in tanks. An excited Plastic Man accidentally deploys the submarine instead, falling into a treetop. Wonder Woman is shot out of the sky and Batman is outmaneuvered and immobilized. It'll take a miracle to get out of HIVE's crosshairs.",
