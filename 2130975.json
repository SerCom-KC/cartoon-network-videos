  "description": "Superman has Metallo subdued enough to take him back to prison, but when the arch-villain presses a button on his breastplate, it throws Superman in a Kryptonite spotlight, putting him on his knees. Firestorm tries to help, but keeps changing the harmful green Kryptonite into other colors, red, gold, pink and black. Chided by the professor, Firestorm tries hard to remember the formula to neutralize the deadly element.",
