  "description": "The Joker and Batman duke it out on a Gotham City rooftop. In their between punch banter, Batman calls the Joker's jokes, \"old, but never funny.\" The villain takes offense and drops a pair of gas bombs, then escapes the explosion with a jet pack, which gets taken down with a Batarang.
