  "description": "The gang puts their favorite items in a Time Capsule to send 100 years in the future, but they get stuck inside right before the door seals. Dr Fox tries to convince the gang to let her use their favorite items to escape the capsule, and each character tells a story about why their favorite item is their favorite, and why Dr Fox can't destroy it to escape. Finally it's revealed that Unikitty's favorite thing was friendship and she trapped everyone in the capsule on purpose, so the future could see their friendship! Unfortunately for the gang, even after they surrender their favorite items to escape, it doesn't work and they have to wait 100 years to finally leave the capsule.",
