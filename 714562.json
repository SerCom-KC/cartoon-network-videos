  "description": "Pato packs his bag of toys and heads off to play with Octopus and Whale underwater. Unfortunately none of his toys work in the sea, and he doesn't like the food so he's all set to head back home. But then Whale shows Pato how fun things can be underwater once you get used to it. Pato has a wonderful time riding on Whale's back, bouncing on sea sponges and playing in a bubble. Finally Pocoyo and Elly arrive too and everyone has a splashy underwater party together.",
