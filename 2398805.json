  "description": "When he accidentally causes all the lamp posts in Vicarstown to fall and shatter, an embarrassed Sir Topham Hatt requests Thomas to go on a secret mission to Harwick for replacements in time for the evening concert. Even though he tries to follow orders \"discreetly,\" Thomas ends up involving Percy, Diesel, Bruno, and other engines! As they travel to Harwick and the not-so-secret mission is shared between them, Thomas and friends discover that everyone makes mistakes -- and no one needs to be embarrassed about being embarrassed among friends.",
