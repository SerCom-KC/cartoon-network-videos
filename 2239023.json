The two need to get to the bottom of it and return things back to normal./ Magnus and Ajit spot Haavik on the street and decide to follow him, but the shape shifting Haavik is on to them. It's not long before an epic brawl breaks out between them - Five Faction Fusion Sabrus vs. Nillious X Darkus and Pharol.",
