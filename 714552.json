  "description": "Wowâ€¦ Presents! One for Pocoyo, one for Elly and one for Pato! How exciting. Pocoyo's present is some string, Pato gets some paper and Elly some sticks. They have fun for a while, each playing with their own present in a bid to prove that it's the best of the bunch. But ultimately the friends get a little bored with their respective gifts. After all, there's only so much you can do with one thing. In a huff, the friends throw their new toys on the floor. And this is when they see the potential of the presents: they can combine them. They put the presents together to make a kite. Wonderful, something they can all play with together.",
