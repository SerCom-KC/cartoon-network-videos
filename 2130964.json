  "description": "Lobo has big plans to earn a $100 million bounty on The Flash and \"retire on the beach.\" He uses a distress signal to lure Superman and the Flash to a desert planet (that looks a lot like the setting for Wile E. Coyote's attempts to catch Road Runner). He puts Superman out of commission with a Kryptonite ray gun and cage. Try as Lobo does to catch \"the red speedster,\" the Flash gets around every one of his tricks in a funny salute to the Looney Tunes classics.",
