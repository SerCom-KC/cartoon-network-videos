  "description": "A shy, puny member of the Bad Crowd shows up at the Cloudseeker claiming he's been kicked out of Blusterland for being nice. The Bears, leery at first, take him in despite Grumpy's suspicions that he is in cahoots with Bluster. It appears Grumpy is right - but thanks to the Care Bears, the little guy turns into a good friend with the courage to thwart Bluster's latest scheme.",
