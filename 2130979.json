Green Arrow gets rid of his loudmouth friend, who returns as a fire hydrant, a rat, and a cat to get closer to the Penguin's HQ. He finds the villain and his thugs, so he delivers himself to their door as a pizza. Inside, it's time to show what he can do against the Penguin and his minions. Now, where's Green Arrow?",
