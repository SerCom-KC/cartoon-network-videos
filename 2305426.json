His Reflection looks just like him but is far more mischievous. The Reflection soon discovers that he can get sweets by scaring people and starts going after all of Pocoyo's friends. They think it's the real Pocoyo, so the Reflection is causing a lot of trouble for poor Pocoyo. Will he be able to clear up the confusion?",
