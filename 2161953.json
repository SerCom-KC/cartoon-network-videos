Mystery Inc. quickly learns that this state-of-the-art cooking resort isn't all steak and potatoes after they find out about the legend of the Red Ghost, and the unsolved disappearance of Bobby Flay's great ancestor chef. When the mysterious Red Ghost returns in disastrous fashion to haunt the inn, the gang teams up with Bobby and his culinary pal Giada De Laurentiis, to dig in for clues and serve up justice. Will history repeat itself and find another world-famous chef missing?",
