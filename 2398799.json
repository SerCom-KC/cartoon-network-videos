  "description": "When Diesel discovers that he doesn't JUST like to be known for his incredible strength, he finds an unlikely compatriot in Kenji -- who is tired of only being known for his swift speed. Diesel and Kenji decide that they are going to switch jobs for the day to show to the other engines that they're more than just their most obvious abilities. However, when both struggle in their reversed roles, Diesel and Kenji learn that it's not so bad being the strongest or the fastest... as long as you get to try new things every now and then!",
