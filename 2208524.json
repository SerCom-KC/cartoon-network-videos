  "description": "When investigating a haunted old hospital, Scooby Doo and the gang meet up with actor and comedian Kristen Schaal. The gang happily invites her to be a part of their mystery solving group, and she's ecstatic. She tags along with our gang helping them solve the mystery of the horrible ghost of Dr. Phineas Phrag. More genetically enhanced monster than man, he's been lurking in this hospital since it closed down in the 1950s, and he threatens to destroy any trespassers who dare set foot in these creepy old wards. Can our gang and Ms. Schaal discover the truth of this haunted hospital before it's too late? More importantly, can Kristen Schaal find out how she best fits into our group? So many fun choices - so little time!",
