Each of the characters takes turns adding onto the last story, going through a haunted glove to a haunted action figure to haunted everything, and even a spooky song! None work in scaring the kids when suddenly a full scale alien invasion happens right before their eyes! Still, the trick or treaters are unimpressed until Richard takes the story stage and delivers a story no kid wants to hear- instead of candy, the trick or treaters would get granola bars! The kids, and Puppycorn, run away screaming.",

In desperation to not burn alive, Master Frown tells Unikitty a story about a younger Master Frown who was gifted a special lollipop but after a freak chain of events, was broken right before his eyes. Unikitty cries her eyes out and puts out the fires and then reveals it was her plan all along to get Master Frown to talk about his feelings!",
