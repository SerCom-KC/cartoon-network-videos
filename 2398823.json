  "description": "Gordon has a day-long assignment for Thomas and the Troublesome Trucks -- they have to transport delivery after delivery to Vicarstown! The Troublesome Trucks are less than enthused -- this \"sameroo\" job will bore them out of their bolts! The Number One Engine is determined to make the day \"amazeroo\" for them and does his best to turn their repeated route into a new adventure! After their game of \"Switcheroo\" gets them lost, Thomas and the Troublesome Trucks learn that routine is not necessarily a bad thing -- in fact, it can be very helpful!",
