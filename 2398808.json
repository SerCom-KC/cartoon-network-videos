  "description": "After yet another victorious race, Kana seems unbeatable! No engine on the island is as fast as Kana! However, this does not stop Sandy from challenging the electric engine. Everyone is sure Kana will win again. Sandy picks the route for the race, using her smarts and her small stature to her advantage! By focusing on her own strengths rather than comparing to Kana's strengths, she makes a fast track to victory!",
