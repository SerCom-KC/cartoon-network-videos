  "description": "An angry alien finds his way to Pocoyo's world and declares that he wants to be king. Pocoyo, Elly and Caterpillar are all friendly but the alien just bosses them around and tries to scare them. When the alien tells Pato what to do, Pato finds it rather helpful. This goes against what the alien was expecting. Finally the alien is upset because he's not getting the reaction he wanted. He sobs and sobs. Pocoyo et al are concerned and kind. The alien realizes that he is likable, and if he'd just stop being so angry, he could have fun.",
