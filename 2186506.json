  "description": "The gang is taking an airplane trip together, and Hawk is at the helm since today he's taking his captain's license test. However Richard is terrified of flying, so Unikitty & Puppycorn spend the chaotic flight trying to help Rick conquer his fear of flying while Dr Fox joins Hawk in the cockpit to help him pass his test. After a destructive and dangerous flight, Rick makes it safetly back on the ground (after surviving the plane crashing). Hawk fails his test but gets to take it again next week, so the gang is excited for another free flight.",
