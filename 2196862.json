His ancestors are from this area, and he has a lot of cousins in town and was just visiting. But, he's being plagued by fire monster attacks. Our gang teams up with Mr. Buscemi to get to the bottom of this fiery mystery. Let's hope Mr. Buscemi can train our gang to be proper fire fighters and mystery solvers, before they all get burned.",
