  "description": "Pato finds an egg and immediately falls in love with it: he wants to take care of the little baby inside the egg. When the egg hatches he gets the shock of his life: it's not a cute little duckling at all, but a very odd looking spider. His friends are terrified of the little creature and won't play with Pato if he brings it along. Pato rather craftily and meanly makes the little spider go away and do things on its own, so Pato can play with Pocoyo and Elly. Finally the little spider makes their hearts melt when he shows them that there's nothing to be scared of and he just wants to be their friend.",
