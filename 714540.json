  "description": "Pocoyo and Pato find Elly's scooter and decide to take it back to her. Pato enjoys showing off his scooter skills and quickly forgets who it belongs to. Pato's scooter tricks get bigger and bigger until eventually he breaks the scooter into pieces. Pocoyo and Pato try to fix the scooter but it's no good. However will they tell Elly? At first they try to cover up what they've done but eventually they have to confess. Thankfully Elly is not upset with them as she has another scooter and is just pleased her friends told the truth in the end.",
