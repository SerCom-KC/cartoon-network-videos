  "description": "When Bruno comes along to help Diesel get a heavy load to the Lighthouse, Bruno tries suggesting a safer route, but Diesel doesn't wait long enough to listen to him. When Diesel barrels though Crumble Canyon, Bruno must brake hard to keep them safe. The squeal causes a rock avalanche and blocks them in. Diesel learns to open his ears to collaborate with Bruno on a solution that uses both their strengths to get out.",
