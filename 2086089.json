  "description": "The gang heads to Shaggy's beloved grandmother's Florida retirement home, where they learn a crazed Ape Man has been frightening the elderly residents. In order to lessen Shaggy's worry that he doesn't give his Grammy enough bragging rights, the gang pretends Shaggy is their leader and Daphne, his adoring girlfriend, inadvertently putting more pressure on Shaggy to solve the mystery of the Ape Man - who, as it turns out, is less horrifying than the shorts Fred decided to wear to beat the Florida heat.",
