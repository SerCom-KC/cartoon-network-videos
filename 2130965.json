  "description": "HIVE has hit four major tech rooms, and Stargirl keeps an eye out to catch them in the act. But while she's waiting, flirty Firestorm would like nothing more than to impress her by shouting nerdy terms, coached by Prof. Martin Stein (\"Keynesian economics, Hegelian dialecticism!\") which makes her yawn. As she fends off HIVE's violent attack, Firestorm throws out theory after theory, but it's not helping much. Will he be able to use his own powers and dazzle her at the same time?",
