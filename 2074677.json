  "description": "Gumball and Darwin discover Tobias is doing way better than them in an online game called Galatrek. Tobias admits he earns good points doing chores for his parents, which he then exchanges for dollars to buy cool stuff for Galatrek. If Gumball and Darwin do Tobias' chores they can earn his good points and use them for Galatrek. Gumball and Darwin think they've hit the jackpot. But these good points may not be quite as good as Tobias claims.",
