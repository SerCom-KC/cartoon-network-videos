  "description": "There's a new girl at Crystal Cove High named Alice May and she's set her romantic sights on Fred. Only one problem, Alice is dead! That's right, Fred's new girlfriend is a dead girl. Alice is a ghost, famous for snatching up guys like Fred and disappearing with them forever. Now, she wants to take Fred to the prom, which means he's next. Fortunately, Daphne also wants to go to the prom with Fred and she's not going to let Alice beat her to the \"punch\" bowl (wink-wink). And what about the rest of the gang? Well, they've got problems of their own. See, Velma wants to go the prom with Shaggy but Scooby wants Shaggy to watch a Vincent Van Ghoul marathon with him. You keeping up? Good because this one is going to get nasty and when it's over, Scooby and the gang will never be the same again.",
