  "description": "Pocoyo finds a fantastic new toy: a machine that makes things invisible! He wants to show his friends his exciting discovery but they are too busy doing their own thing. Pocoyo is miffed but then realizes that he can have some fun with them, without them knowing about it. He makes himself invisible and starts to undertake various sneaky antics which utterly dumbfound his pals. Things get out of hand when Pato blames Elly and Elly blames Pato - even though we all know it's really Pocoyo's fault. Finally the truth is revealed when Baby Bird presses the button on the machine and Pocoyo is de-invisible-ised! In the end, they all play at being invisible together.",
