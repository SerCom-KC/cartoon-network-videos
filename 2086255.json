  "description": "Principal Waller tells Poison Ivy that she needs to join a club in order to fulfill her extracurricular requirements. However, clubs are not introverted Ivy's idea of fun. Hawkgirl and Bumblebee invite Ivy to join the Junior Detective Society. Miss Martian and Starfire give Ivy the pitch for the Model United Planets. Katana and Beast Boy want her for Band Club. But then, the glimmering test tubes of Science Club catch Ivy's eye. Ivy adds her name to the sign-up sheet manned by Frost and Flash. Later, during the first Science Club meeting, Ivy shows off her modified plants, which creates chaos for Star Sapphire. Ivy grins. Clubs are fun!",
