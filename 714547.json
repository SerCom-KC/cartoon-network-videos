  "description": "Pocoyo finds a seed. He can't wait for it to grow. He guards it lovingly but can't prevent his friends from taking an interest in the seed too. Sleepy Bird thinks it would make a tasty snack but Pocoyo stops her from munching it just in time. Loula thinks it's a toy to bury and Pato thinks it's an egg. Finally Pocoyo erects a comprehensive security system to protect his seed but Elly accidentally knocks it over. Pocoyo's seed grows into a beautiful flower. But Loula picks it and shakes it. Pocoyo is upset until he realizes - -with our help - that Loula's shaking of the flower has simply made more seeds fall on the ground, and therefore more beautiful flowers have grown.",
