  "description": "Whilst travelling through the notoriously dangerous Forest of Outlaws, Prince Ivandoe is repeatedly Princenapped! First by a gang of wolves in disguise, then by Boaris and his Merry Boars, and finally by Feral and her gang of cat-thieves - all of them hoping to secure a royal ransom. Luckily for Prince Ivandoe and Bert, they are rescued by the fair Jezabel - though, as it turns out, not with the noblest of intentions.",
