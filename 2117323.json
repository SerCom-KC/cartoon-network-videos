  "description": "Wonder Woman is teaching Frost how to fly the Invisible Jet when Killer Moth detects them and begins to attack. Frost takes the ejector Turbo Seat to fight back. However, the jet is damaged by Killer Moth's ship, and the jet begins to plummet. The ship goes into emergency lockdown and Wonder Woman is trapped. She manages to lift the jet from the inside and crash into the bay instead of the city. Frost makes a giant ice cube that allows the jet to float and freezes Killer Moth's plane. With Killer Moth defeated, Supergirl melts the ice around Wonder Woman's jet and Batgirl restores functionality to the jet's tech. Wonder Woman emerges unscathed.",
