  "description": "Pocoyo and Pato are having fun ice-skating. Elly is a great dancer and wants to have a go, but every time she tries she falls over flat on her bottom. Even Whale and Octopus put on a great duet ice-skating routine. Poor Elly is about to give up. But we encourage her to have another go, and Pocoyo and Pato help her to get started. Gradually she gets the hang of it and her confidence increases till she performs an amazing routine and achieves the highest score of the day.",
