  "description": "Let's play Hide and Seek! Pocoyo is the seeker and is brilliant at it - but only thanks to Loula. When Loula gets all the praise for being a super-seeker, Pocoyo is jealous. He throws a ball very far away to make Loula run off and chase it. His friends think it was a nasty thing to do and so Pocoyo feels bad and decides he must now find Loula. They follow her footprints but she's gone really far and they just can't find her anywhere. Finally at an island in the sea they despair: they think she's gone forever. But we can already see that Loula is safe and sound. Everyone is reunited and Pocoyo can celebrate being a super-seeker too, after all.",
