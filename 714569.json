  "description": "Pocoyo is flicking though a picture book when he sees something he's never seen before: a horse! He's amazed and obsessed. He desperately wants to have a horse. He searches everywhere and can talk of nothing but horses. His friends try to make a horse for him but Pocoyo rejects their attempt. Elly and Pato were only trying to help and now they're completely exasperated. Pocoyo is going mad - and driving them mad - just talking about horses all the time. Elly starts to cry in despair. Pocoyo realises that he's been driving them crazy and that they were only trying to help. He understands that there are no real horses in Pocoyo's world and he'll just have to do without. He plays with the pretend horse that Elly and Pato made and has loads of fun.",
