  "description": "Donut Cop shows Gumball and Darwin that the smallest misdemeanour can lead to a breakdown in law.  Gumball jaywalks and is pulled over by Donut Cop. When Gumball objects he is told that even the smallest misdemeanor can lead to a breakdown in law. In an effort to impress the kids Donut Cop takes them for a ride-along in his cop car and gets carried away, progressively breaking the law himself. He soon proves that the tiniest offense can indeed snowball into complete lawlessness!",
