  "description": "Something's odd in the JL Watchtower, Batman has released Poison Ivy from lockup and is giving her a ride home! When Plastic Man protests, one fluff of Ivy's hair releases mind control spores, which he bats away. He follows her into the garage, where she and Batman, on the Batcycle, charge across a bridge of seaweed that Ivy has created toward Metropolis. Plastic Man gives chase, dodging the Batcycle's defensive gadgets. At the docks, there's one last chance for Plastic Man to keep himself alive and break the power of Ivy's spores.",
