  "description": "Cyborg has good news and bad. Good: he's added lots of new action figures to his collectible toys. Bad: Toyman has turned all the \"Bot-Bots,\" which he's been collecting since childhood, into weapons. In the ensuing battle, a hysterical Cyborg needs to choose whether he's willing to destroy or damage his precious mint condition collectibles, or be a victim of their destruction. Will he stop the battle before they lose all their value, or will he allow Toyman, and his new toy army, to destroy Justice League's headquarters?",
