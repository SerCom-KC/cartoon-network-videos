  "description": "It's a blustery day on Sodor and Percy finds that his preferred route is closed! He must journey into Crumble Canyon -- a place that makes him terribly nervous! But before he can face his fears, Diesel blasts by, bonking his cargo of blue paint all over the jittery mail engine! Percy is unrecognizable as himself -- instead, he looks just like Thomas! His impromptu makeover inspires Percy to be brave just like his best loco-migo -- and pretend to be the Number One Engine for the day! When Whiff loses his glasses, Percy escorts him across the island and learns that the bravery isn't in the blue paint -- it's inside him!",
