  "description": "After a mishap in the lab, everyone in the castle- except for Puppycorn- is shrunk to tiny size! Puppycorn thinks it's cool. His friends are like living action figures! So he begins playing with them in imaginary adventures. Unikitty and the others think being miniature and playing with Puppycorn is surprisingly fun, but PC has a habit of accidentally breaking his toys, and it's soon clear the gang will have to make a daring, tiny escape back to the lab before Puppycorn loves them to pieces!\n",
