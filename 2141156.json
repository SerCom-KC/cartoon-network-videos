  "description": "Disappointed when his friends don't laugh at his jokes, Funshine encounters the Laffinpuff, a magical comedian who grants Funshine's wish to make everyone think he's funny. But Funshine realizes it's no fun being funny when people laugh at everything he says, whether he means it to be funny or not. To get the wish rescinded, he must face the Laffinpuff in a grueling ordeal of slapstick humor.",
