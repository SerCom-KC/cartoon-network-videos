  "description": "After Percy gets in an accident and ends up with a broken axle, Nia temporarily takes over his mail delivery duties for him - and her mail delivery is even quicker! Percy thinks the replacement is permanent. In an attempt to find his new thing, Percy tries out different jobs all over Sodor, but nothing seems to fit him quite right. When he's just about ready to give up and head to the mainland, everyone agrees quick is not better. They all miss Percy's caring, careful way of delivering the mail. He's the best engine for the job!",
