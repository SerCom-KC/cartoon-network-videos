Things aren't going Gumball's way at school so he assumes there must be a Secret Society that gives preferential treatment to its own members. He tries everything to uncover this non-existent society, making everyone's lives miserable in the process. Eventually, in an attempt to restore some peace, the pupils and teachers decide to give him exactly what he wants.",
