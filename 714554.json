  "description": "Pocoyo and Elly have organized a picnic and they leave Pato in charge of guarding the sandwiches while they get everything ready. Incredibly the sandwiches suddenly start moving around. Pato can't believe his eyes. When Pocoyo and Elly return they are angry with Pato. They think he took the sandwiches himself. They give him one more chance, leaving him in charge of guarding the cake. Once again, amazingly, the cake runs away apparently on its own. Pato is once again berated by Pocoyo and Elly until they see what's going on with their own eyes. Pocoyo investigates further and discovers who it is that's moving the food around: ANTS! Having worked out what's going on, the friends invite the ants along to the picnic and they all have fun together.",
