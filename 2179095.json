  "description": "Mush-Mush is very proud he invented a new game called Fruity Bounce, where he and his friends bounce as high as possible on the bouncier fruits they can find. Little did he know, the Mushups were fruit-bouncing way before he, Chep and Lilit did. So, Mush-Mush decides that if he can't be the inventor of the game, he'll at least be the best at it. Mushlers vs Mushups, game on!",
