  "description": "Elly invites her chums to a tea party but they don't want to come because they know how bossy Elly is at her tea parties. The tea parties are no fun because Elly is always barking out rules and orders. But when Pocoyo and Pato smell Elly's gorgeous biscuits, they realize what they're missing out on and they change their minds. They really want to go to her tea party now. Before they can dig into the biscuits though, Elly bosses them around. Pocoyo and Pato are exasperated and leave Elly to it. Elly realizes that her friends are sad, and a tea party isn't really a tea party unless you've got friends there with you. So Elly stops being bossy, and they all have a fun party eating the treats together.",
