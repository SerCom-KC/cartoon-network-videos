  "description": "A hulking robot robs Gotham City National Bank, but it's Cyborg! Toyman has a remote to control his actions. Now Batman is pitted against his own friend, who whips the Batmobile behind him till Batman stops him with a tire \"boot.\" In rocket shoes, Toyman propels himself to the harbor and onto a rubber ducky raft, actually a controlled Plastic Man, who Batman hooks before his ally becomes a reluctant escape airplane. Now Batman needs to call on all of his genius to save his friends.",
