  "description": "Baby Bird is in awe of Pocoyo as he plays skillfully with a bouncy ball. Baby Bird continues to admire Pocoyo but this time it's his construction skills as Pocoyo plays with his blocks. And yes, Baby Bird thinks Pocoyo is the best at painting too. At first Pocoyo thinks it's great to have an admirer but soon, Pocoyo can't do anything without Baby Bird interrupting. Eventually Pocoyo gets so frustrated that he sends Baby Bird away. Pocoyo enjoys doing everything all by himself but it's not long before he wonders where his friend Baby Bird has gone. When Pocoyo realizes that Baby Bird was only trying to be his friend Pocoyo decides to invite Baby Bird to a party especially for him.",
