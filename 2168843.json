  "description": "The Land Lord has threatened Master Frown and Brock with eviction unless they fix the damage they've done to their apartment. Worried, Brock invites Unikitty and the gang to help. Instead of doing what the guys want to their place, she proceeds to do what she wants. Realizing her error, she returns the apartment to its former disgusting state, but now Frown and Brock are in danger of eviction again. They must team up with Unikitty and the gang to battle the Land Lord and save their home.",
