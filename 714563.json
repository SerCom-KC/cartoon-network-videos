  "description": "Everyone's preparing for a painting exhibition. Everyone except Pato who says he's not bothered about painting. When the show opens, Pato unexpectedly exhibits his paintings: they are amazing masterpieces (Actually they are real masterpieces. He didn't paint them!). Everyone is very impressed and asks him to paint another. But he can't, because in fact he cheated: he didn't paint these pictures at all. Pocoyo and the audience encourage Pato to have a go at painting. He paints a beautiful flower and feels very pleased with himself. His painting takes its place in the exhibition.",
