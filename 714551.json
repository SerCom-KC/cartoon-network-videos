  "description": "When Sleepy Bird has to pop out for a while, she needs someone to look after little Baby Bird. Pato volunteers because he thinks that's going to be a much easier job than tidying up the mess he's made with Pocoyo. Baby Bird, and his chum Caterpillar, run rings round Pato who eventually appeals to Pocoyo for help. Pocoyo thinks he can take care of the situation easily himself, but he similarly is foxed by the little tykes. Finally Pocoyo and Pato work out that in order to get the little ones to do what they want, they are going to need to collaborate. By the time Sleepy Bird returns, Baby Bird and Caterpillar are fast asleep. Little does Sleepy Bird know the chaos that got them to that point!",
