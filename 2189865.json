  "description": "During a fun fireworks show, Unikitty and Master Frown become trapped in the horn of the Unikitty Castle when she catches Master Frown messing with her fireworks. Unikitty takes this as an opportunity to figure out why Master Frown is always such a Cranky McCrabby Face all the time, if only Master Frown would let his emotional guard down! She tries all kinds of tactics, a song, a dance, even a firework with a face drawn on it named \"Professor Pow Pow, licensed therapist\" Getting nowhere, Unikitty ends up raging out and setting the tower and all the fireworks alight. In desperation to not burn alive, Master Frown tells Unikitty a story about a younger Master Frown who was gifted a special lollipop but after a freak chain of events, was broken right before his eyes. Unikitty cries her eyes out and puts out the fires and then reveals it was her plan all along to get Master Frown to talk about his feelings!",
