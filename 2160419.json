  "description": "Hawkodile's caught by the Action Police for bodyguarding without an Action License. He's can't protect the kingdom or do anything rad until he does, but the test at the DMV (The Department of Mayhem and Violence) is for nerds! Forced to retire his gloves, Hawkodile struggles to live a life without punching, so Unikitty vows to help her friend contain his urge to be action-y and study for the test. But there's more to the test than meets the eye.",
