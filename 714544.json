  "description": "Pato and Elly are arguing over their blocks when Caterpillar and Baby Bird walk past with presents for Pato. Oh no! Pocoyo and Elly have forgotten Pato's birthday. Elly is quick to whisk Pato off to a birthday picnic, determined to prove how much she cares. Not to be outdone, quick-thinking Pocoyo appears at the picnic with a present but Elly retaliates and 'accidentally' breaks it. Pocoyo and Elly fight so hard over Pato that he's almost broken in two. Fed up with all the fight Pato packs his things and is about to leave. When Pocoyo and Elly realize that their fighting has driven Pato away, they quickly make up and turn their efforts into making a special birthday party for Pato.",
