  "description": "Lois Lane believes that Clark Kent is Superman, so the Man of Steel enlists Plastic Man to put the doubt back by having him pose as Clark. Lois lures \"Clark\" to the Daily Planet rooftop and jumps to test him, but she's rescued by, Superman!  But he's hit with red Sun radiation beamed by an armored Lex Luthor, who wants a retraction of Lois's \"lies\" about him in the paper. The weakened Superman is no match for Luthor in (body armor), so Plastic Man has to stretch to the occasion.",
