  "description": "The engines are revved up for their homemade obstacle course event known as the Tri-and-a-half-a-lon. During practice, Nia worries that she's never been able to beat the timer, but Sandy and Carly encourage her to keep practicing before the event the next day. Nia becomes so committed that she overworks herself, zooming all over the island well into the night. The morning of the event, Nia finds she's so tired she isn't sure if she can race, but she pushes through, learning that while practice is good, too much practice can wear you out so much that you miss the fun.",
