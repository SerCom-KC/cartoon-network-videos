  "description": "The Awesome Brawlers and Haavik: It's the Haavik Show! Haavik shows up unexpectedly at the practice field and proposes he and Dan play a little game. The Awesome Brawlers have never seen this man before, but they sense something is odd about him. Regardless, when Haavik strokes Dan's ego, there's no way he's backing down from this challenge./First Fusion! Drago and Tretorous: With his back against the wall, Dan tries flipping the script on Haavik by challenging him to a game of his own - a Bakugan Brawl. If Dan wins, then Haavik will have to set him, and the other Awesome Brawler's free.",
