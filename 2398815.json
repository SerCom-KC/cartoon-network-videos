  "description": "With Thomas in a rush to get a ton of hay bales delivered to the mainland by the end of the day, he tasks Terence the Tractor and Carly to assemble all the bales in his stead. Carly and Terence manage to get everything together quickly, but soon Terence purposefully crashes into the hay bales sending loose hay all over the place! Carly is shocked and confused, and Terence explains that he can bale the hay again with his trusty baler in no time. They turn the hay-bale stacking into a game, forming all kinds of structures Terence can crash into, until they finally form the tallest hay tower ever. When Thomas finally arrives to pick up the hay, he's worried they won't have enough time to complete the delivery, but Terence reminds him that they can work and have fun all at the same time.",
