Robin is bound and determined to remedy that situation by becoming a star instead of a sidekick. With a few madcap ideas and a song in their hearts, the Teen Titans head to Hollywood to fulfill their dreams. Things soon go awry, however, when a super villain plans to take over the planet -- putting the very fate of the young heroes on the line. Based on the television series.",
