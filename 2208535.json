  "description": "Scooby and our mystery solving gang are on set with famous singer, dancer, comedian and actress Sandy Duncan. She's back at Mammoth Studios (where our gang first met her) because they're at it again. They're making a remake of the original Jekyll & Hyde movie that Sandy starred in and where Daphne stepped in as Ms. Duncan's stunt double. It seems everything is going well until the same thing happens all over again. A real monster Jekyll starts showing up and causing mayhem, kidnapping actors and scaring everyone away. Can Sandy Duncan and our mystery solving gang survive this savage new Jekyll monster and solve the movie mystery? Even harder, can they survive the angry, emotional movie director!?",
