  "description": "Puppycorn is determined to become the Hot Dog King and joins an underground hot dog eating contest called Weiner Club. Rick warns \"you are what you eat,\" but Puppycorn doesn't listen and eats so many hot dogs he becomes the new champion of Weiner Club. Unfortunately he also literally turns into a hot dog, that the other club members reveal they are going to eat! Unikitty and the gang now must attack with vegetables and defeat the hot dog-eating baddies in order to save the giant hot-dog-shaped Puppycorn and turn him back to normal.",
