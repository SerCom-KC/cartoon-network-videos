  "description": "This is Jeopardy! In fact, this is a very special episode of Jeopardy for two reasons. First, Velma and Shaggy are contestants. And second, they're competing against Andy the Brain Bot (a semi-sentient super-smart robot), who's standing at the lecterns with them. Scooby and our gang of mystery solvers are super excited to meet famous TV personality and gameshow host Alex Trebek! But, it's lucky our heroes are on hand because when Velma and Shaggy start outscoring the Brain Bot, it causes the robot to go a little crazy. It threatens to destroy everything if it can't manage to win. Our gang and Mr. Trebek must get to the bottom of who's really behind this robot's dangerous actions, or when they say Final Jeopardy, they really mean it!",
