  "description": "When Cranky gets overwhelmed on a busy and blustery day at Brendam Docks, he accidentally gets Riff and Jiff's names confused, sending them on opposite deliveries. An observant Thomas hears the mistake, but does not correct the crankier-than-usual crane -- thinking, grown-ups don't make mistakes! Thomas is proven wrong, however, when he ends up at Whiff's Recycling Plant and old tires are delivered to McColl's Farm because of Cranky's error. After calming the chaos in both places, Thomas learns that it is important to speak up and tell someone they are making a mistake --- even if it is a grown-up!",
