When Floyd accidentally locks them inside the studio moments before airtime, they are forced to put on today's program all by themselves!/Backstage Bugs: Baby Bugs can't wait to see his favorite children's musical group, The Wormies, and he absolutely thrills to the notion of possibly meeting his personal hero, Willie Wormie, backstage after the show. But Bugs fails to heed Floyd's warning about staying with the group in the crowded arena and suffers consequences when he gets separated from Floyd.",
