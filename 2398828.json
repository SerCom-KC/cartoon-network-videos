  "description": "Ever since he met Boxy on his day off, Thomas has been doing deliveries and making memories with his boxcar buddy! However, Thomas' careless speed is taking its toll on Boxy, and when Thomas is tasked with delivering important items to the Vicarstown Museum, his fragile friend begins to bounce bolts and lose slats at a rapid rate! Even though Thomas apologizes for his behavior, he does not slow his pace -- a decision that causes permanent damage to Boxy. Through his mistake, Thomas learns that he should have taken better precautions with his insentient pal -- and vows to do better in the future.",
