  "description": "Richard has decided to take Unikitty and the gang for a pleasant and relaxing 10 hour road trip. At first everyone is against the trip, but they soon start to have fun. Unfortunately, their idea of fun is not Richard's.  He soon begins to give in to his inner road-rage. To make matters worse they are being chased by a killer semi-truck, and their car has been invaded by weird bug hitchhiker.  Will Richard loose it, or will the trip be a great success?",
