  "description": "Thomas and Percy are excited to deliver a special balloon for the hot-air balloon festival, but the balloon is wrapped up tight. They're instructed not to peek at it until they arrive. While making the delivery, part of the balloon pops out of its tarp and the wind carries it skyward, along with Percy. Percy never expected to enjoy a flight that much! Now it's up to Thomas to get help from Harold and Beresford in order to bring Percy home.",
