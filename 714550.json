  "description": "Pocoyo, Elly and Baby Bird have great fun making lots of noise. But what's music to their ears is a real old racket to poor Pato who's trying to have a nap. Pocoyo, Elly and Baby Bird agree to try to be more considerate. But then they find another wonderful way to make music - by bouncing balls. Again, their music wakes up the sleepy duck. Finally Pocoyo and his chums make a cacophony with lots of machines. Pato completely loses his cool. Pocoyo's attempt at a soothing lullaby does nothing to calm the ever-more exhausted quacker. Pato realizes there's no other way round this - he's going to have to conduct them himself. In so doing, he really gets into it and the music gives him lots of energy. He's no longer sleepy and everyone's playing brilliant harmonious music together.",
