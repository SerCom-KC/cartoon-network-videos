  "description": "A hideous creature named Que Horrifico is turning the children of Crystal Cove in to monsters. The adults in the town are in shock, reacting in the only way they know how, by abandoning their children and running away like cowards. Only Scooby and the gang stay behind to solve the mystery. Going undercover as a family - \"Dad\" Fred, \"Mom\" Daphne, \"Grandma\" Velma, \"Son\" Shaggy and \"Baby\" Scooby - the gang rents a house in order to capture Que Horrifico. But when their plan backfires and Que Horrifico uses his power over the monster children to cause them to attack the gang, it looks like all is lost. That is until a cartoon character named Broccoli Head comes to their rescue.",
