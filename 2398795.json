  "description": "When Gordon is given an all-day responsibility on the far side of Sodor, he recruits Thomas to be the temporary \"Engine in Charge.\" Even though he advises Thomas about the importance of listening to his team, Thomas assigns tasks to Nia, Diesel, Percy, and Kana that do not match their strengths. With Sandy and Carly as backup, Thomas must fix his errors, use Gordon's advice, and make sure everyone's deliveries are complete before the end-of-day whistle!",
