  "description": "Driving through Africa, Fred takes a wrong turn at Nairobi on the Mombasa rally race. He drives the gang and the Mystery Machine into some dense jungle in a lost valley at the base of Mount Kilimanjaro. Here, they meet none-other than Jessica Biel, who is climbing Kilimanjaro. She's done it before and loved it so much that she's at it again only from a different approach. But when they get attacked by a twenty-foot tall monster gorilla, they soon have a serious mystery on their hands, one that might lead to the discovery of the legendary lost mines of King Solomon!!!",
