  "description": "It's Halloween again and the gang is desperately trying to tell the scariest story to a couple of trick or treaters. Each of the characters takes turns adding onto the last story, going through a haunted glove to a haunted action figure to haunted everything, and even a spooky song! None work in scaring the kids when suddenly a full scale alien invasion happens right before their eyes! Still, the trick or treaters are unimpressed until Richard takes the story stage and delivers a story no kid wants to hear- instead of candy, the trick or treaters would get granola bars! The kids, and Puppycorn, run away screaming.",
