  "description": "When the gang meets up with famous fright-writer Ben Ravencroft, he invited them to New England for his hometown's bit Autumn Harvest Festival. Things take a supernatural detour when they learn the place is haunted by Ben's ancestor Sarah! Will the mystery reveal that Sarah was a good-hearted healer or a spell-casting witch? Before you can say, \"Scooby Snacks\", the gang is on the case tangling with bumbling mummies, monster turkeys and (zoinks) a ghostly secret hidden in the Ravencroft family's past! Grooving to the tunes of the movie's rocking band The Hex Girls, it's Scooby-Doo at his spellbinding, spine-tingling, super-sleuthing best!",
