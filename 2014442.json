Gumball confronts Clayton about his fabled Seven Pressure Point Heart Exploding Technique, assuming it's another one of his outlandish claims. Darwin and Gumball intervene to help Clayton start embracing the truth. However, when they discover the move is as effective as he claimed, they really wish he'd been lying.",
