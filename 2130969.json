  "description": "Wonder Woman explains that \"bonding is important\" as they unite to fight fires, explosions, and tendrils of monstrous vines that choke off the city. It's all the work of Poison Ivy and her Ivy League. Her gigantic Venus Flytrap of a vine squeezes Batman, Star Sapphire bats away Superman's attempts to catch her, Cheetah puts the Flash out of commission, and Ember makes an explosive entrance to finish him off. Wonder Woman steps in to interrupt the mayhem so the boys can get back in the game. They're all for unity, except for the Dark Knight, but the game they end up with is hardly what anyone expected.",
