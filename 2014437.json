  "description": "The kids complain so much they become actual charity cases. Gumball is in such a bad mood that it spreads to Darwin, who joins him in complaining about everything. Their constant moaning grabs the attention of the good people of Elmore. Mistaking Gumball and Darwin for genuine kids in need, they put on a benefit and raise money for them. How do Gumball and Darwin confess there's been a mix-up without inciting a riot?!!",
