What they don't understand is that Radley Crown and his dog are none other than the Blue Falcon and his dog wonder, Dynomutt (who are setting a trap for the Medusa Monster themselves). When our gang's interference causes the Blue Falcon to be taken by the monster, it's up to Dynomutt to put on his Blue Falcon hat and be the brains of the operation. But, he'll need a new Dog Wonder and he picks Scooby-Doo for the job!",
