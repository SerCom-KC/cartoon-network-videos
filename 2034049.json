  "description": "Gumball and Darwin are running late for school but need to arrive in time to avoid expulsion. Gumball and Darwin hit snooze too many times on their alarm clock and miss the school-bus. Miss Simian has threatened to expel them if they don't get to school on time. A mysterious clock appears showing exactly how long they have to get to school. When it looks like they aren't going to make it in time, they stop the clock which effects the space/time continuum.",
