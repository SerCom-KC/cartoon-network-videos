  "description": "Chep knows so many things about nature that Mush-Mush and Lilit are confident he's not far from being an expert like Mushpot. So, when Travel Snail seems unwell, Mush-Mush and Lilit encourage their friend to take care of her in Mushpot's absence. Chep's diagnosis takes everyone by surprise: Travel Snail is expecting baby snails! At least that's what Chep is convinced about.",
