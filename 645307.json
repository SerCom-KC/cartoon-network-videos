  "description": "When the Rustbucket breaks down outside the largest mall in the U.S., it seems Ben and Gwen will have the time of their lives in the mall. That is until they run into an evil hypnotist entertaining the crowd, who puts Ben under hypnosis, causing him to sleepwalk at night and help him steal things. And when the hypnotist discovers certain aliens are now helping him, he exploits them for his grand plan of hypnotizing hundreds of people so they'll be under his demented control forever. Ben must figure out how to break the spell he's under and stop this evil plan.",
