  "description": "The kids finally get the puppy they always wanted, except . . . it's actually a turtle, and it hates them. After begging Dad for a puppy, the kids are taken aback when he comes home with a turtle. Despite the fact that the turtle turns out to be extremely aggressive (especially toward Gumball) they try their best to give it the love it deserves. This achieves nothing. The Evil Turtle escapes and goes on a rampage, and they have to find it before it destroys Elmore.",
