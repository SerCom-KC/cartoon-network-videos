  "description": "Pocoyo is doing a magic show. He expects everyone to watch very carefully and take him very seriously but unfortunately his tricks don't quite go to plan and his friends all laugh. They're really enjoying the show. They think Pocoyo is great at being a funny magician. But that's not what Pocoyo wants to be - he wants to be taken very seriously - so he goes off in a huff. In the meantime, Pato, Elly and Baby Bird go around Pocoyo-land to tell everyone about the magnificent hilarious magician whose show they enjoy so much. As Pocoyo sulks, his friends gather around him, excited to see his tricks. Pocoyo is overwhelmed that his friends liked his show so much. He does some more tricks and his friends are thrilled.",
