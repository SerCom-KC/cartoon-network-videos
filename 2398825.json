  "description": "Sodor welcomes a new engine to the group -- Toby the Tram Engine! Thomas, Diesel, Kana, and the other loco-migos are eager to include their new friend in their deliveries and assigned duties. But as he shadows them, their jobs prove to be a bit too intense for the older engine -- in fact, Toby glumly starts to believe maybe he is too old. Determined to pick up Toby's spirits, Thomas and Sandy get creative and turn an old axle into a \"superaxleatortron\" -- a 'brand-new' part to put the pep back in Toby's confidence! When the plan goes sideways because the other engines want \"super-axles\" too, Toby discovers that he never needed the special part -- he just needed to believe in himself!",
