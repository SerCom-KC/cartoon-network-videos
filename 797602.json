Desperate to stop this beast before it scares away all the tourists, the gang investigates convinced it is a disgruntled local named Skipper Shelton, famous for his delicious clam filled waffle cones, his missing nose and his hatred for Crystal Cove bureaucrats. But when Daphne is captured by the Man Crab, Scooby and the gang have to put the mystery solving into overdrive or risk losing not only Daphne but the sanity of their leader Fred, who is not taking the abduction well.",
