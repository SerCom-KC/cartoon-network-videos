  "description": "An arrogant little frogman needs the help of Prince Ivandoe to lift his curse and become the big, beautiful bullfrog he once was. Due to a technical error, Prince Ivandoe's arms have been magically replaced by slimy froggy ones. So he has no choice but to help lift the curse in order to restore his princely arms. The Frogman's hopeless attempts to find a True Love's kiss end in failure. So Ivandoe and Bert convince him that his only hope is to earn the forgiveness of The Batwitch - his ex-girlfriend - who was responsible for cursing him in the first place.",
