  "description": "When Shaggy and Scooby are excited to visit a scary haunted old castle in Germany, the rest of the gang are confused until they meet up with none other than famous chef, writer and TV presenter Alton Brown! Shaggy, Scooby and Alton are good friends (mostly because they will happily eat any experimental scientific food experiment Alton comes up with). Alton Brown is on the trail of his ancestor, mad scientist Dr. Cornelius Frankenfooder! It's said he made a crazy Monster from animated foodstuffs that haunts this old castle to this day. Mr. Brown has to get to the bottom of this familial mystery. Obviously our gang is on board to help. \"Come for the kooky scientific food creations. Stay for the horrible monster!\"",
