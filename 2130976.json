  "description": "When Mark Hamill (\"Famous Actor\") hails a car for a lift to the Gotham City Conservatory, his driver is none other than The Joker (\"Master Villain\"), accompanied by Trickster (\"2nd Rate Villain\"). Mark is lashed to the back seat as the Joker prepares to ransom him to the studios, \"who'll pay plenty to get you back!\" When the police give chase, the Joker and his \"witless wannabee's\" argument gets heated, causing the Joker to crash the car into a thicket in the middle of the road, Swamp Thing. Whatever could make the two villains go at each other so?",
