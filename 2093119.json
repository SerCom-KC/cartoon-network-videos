He's convinced the only way to shake off this label is to do the opposite of everything he normally would. But Gumball suppressing his natural instincts leaves a vacuum, a Gumball-shaped hole that someone has to fill. That someone is Tobias, who starts turning the whole show into a cliched sitcom.",
