  "description": "Cheer bonds with a migrating firefly-like creature, called a Sparklewing, who stows aboard the Cloudseeker. The two become good friends, but there's a problem: Sparklewings must finish their migration to bring life-giving nutrients to the fields of the Silver Lining. Cheer's difficult and emotional parting with her new friend is only possible once they both accept that it's for a greater good.",
