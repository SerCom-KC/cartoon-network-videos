  "description": "Under cover of night, Justice One streaks away from the Tower with Poison Ivy and Harley Quinn at the controls! The Batwing interrupts their short lived victory. Struck by one of their missiles, the Batwing starts to plummet. Batman slings a grappling hook onto Justice One and tries to get aboard, only to be launched back into the air on the craft's many separate aircraft, including a submarine. Batman gets aboard to face off with Ivy and Harley, but a smashed guidance system sends the ship plummeting. Batman buckles in. What is he doing?",
