  "description": "Lex Luthor plays a deadly game of \"know thine enemy,\" baiting Superman into a remote hideout in search of a kidnapped woman named Brie Gruyere. The super hero pounds Lex through the ceiling of another building housing the victim, where the \"girl\" turns out to be a Kryptonite gas spewing robot. As Superman and Lex ponder aloud the predictability of a foe's actions, it looks like Lex, armed with a Kryptonite club, is winning. But he may not know his enemy as well as he thinks.",
