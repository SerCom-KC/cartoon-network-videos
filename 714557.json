  "description": "Pocoyo finds a puppet theatre and some puppets. Brilliant! Time for him to be a puppeteer. He puts on a show for Caterpillar and Baby Bird. They love it, especially when the puppets do funny things like fall over. They bring Pato and Elly along to watch the show too. When Pocoyo makes fun of Pato and Elly with the puppets, Pato and Elly are nonplussed. They don't think it's so great to laugh at people. Pocoyo realizes that his show has upset his friends. He says sorry and explains he didn't mean it. Everyone makes friends again!",
