  "description": "The Wattersons have had a bad day, but it turns out Larry has too and it's about to get worse . . . for everyone! The Wattersons complain about their day and order a pizza from Larry. When they call to complain about their late pizza it's the final straw for Larry and he quits all of his jobs. Elmore's fragile commercial structure collapses and the citizens revert to a more primitive apocalyptic state.",
