  "description": "A mysterious relative, Uncle Donklecorn, shows up unexpectedly, claiming to be family. Hawkodile thinks it's just Master Frown and Brock in a donkey costume, trying to ruin things as usual, but Unikitty and Puppycorn are convinced Donklecorn is an old family member. Hawk follows his bodyguard senses and tries to prove that Donklecorn is a fake, until finally the real Master Frown and Brock show up and ruin things, just as he suspected they would. He admits he was wrong about Uncle Donklecorn, but all is forgiven and the friends dance it out together.",
