  "description": "Scooby-Doo and our gang of mystery solvers travel up a lost river in the Amazon Rainforest with famous comedian and actor Jason Sudeikis in search of a great treasure, the very first high-top sneaker ever made. It's rumored to be in a lost shoe factory from 1912 that used organic rubber to make its shoes. But the gang and Mr. Sudeikis are being stalked by a horrible Snake Man Monster that seems intent upon stopping them from reaching their destination. Can our gang survive this adventure and solve this sneaker-filled mystery? Can Mr. Sudeikis truly find the very first high-top ever made? Can Scooby-Doo find sneakers that actually fit all four feet?!",
