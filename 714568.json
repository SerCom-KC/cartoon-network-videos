  "description": "Pocoyo wants to play ball but Pato is stubborn: he wants to play on the see-saw. Elly turns up so Pocoyo goes to play catch with her. Pato's left on his own. And the see-saw is no fun on your own. But he has an idea. He gets a machine and makes a copy of himself, a clone. The clone likes playing for a while but when they both want to play with the same toy car, they fall out. So Pato makes another Pato. Every time he makes a new Pato, something goes wrong, because the Patos all want the same thing and are as stubborn as each other. Finally, one of the clone Patos clones itself and soon there are crowds of Patos rampaging all around the place. Pocoyo and Elly to the rescue! They turn off the machine and all the copy Patos disappear. Phewy. To end, Pato plays ball.",
