Carly and Sandy warn the excited engines that they should only cross the bridge in case of an emergency -- a rule that is ignored by Kana, Diesel, Nia, AND Thomas! When the bridge finally collapses and prevents them from reaching Lookout Mountain in time, Harold selflessly chooses to help his friends instead of see the Lights. His sacrifice teaches the young engines an important lesson: your actions add up - stay away until it is safe to play.",

When the plan goes sideways because the other engines want \"super-axles\" too, Toby discovers that he never needed the special part -- he just needed to believe in himself!",

But before he can face his fears, Diesel blasts by, bonking his cargo of blue paint all over the jittery mail engine! Percy is unrecognizable as himself -- instead, he looks just like Thomas! His impromptu makeover inspires Percy to be brave just like his best loco-migo -- and pretend to be the Number One Engine for the day! When Whiff loses his glasses, Percy escorts him across the island and learns that the bravery isn't in the blue paint -- it's inside him!",
