  "description": "Joseph \"Run\" Simmons (aka Reverend Run) originally of Run DMC is opening a hip-hop youth center in Harlem where he hopes to give kids a chance to explore all the powerful sides of Hip-Hop culture. Being huge fans, Shaggy and Scooby have brought the rest of the gang to the grand opening. But, they're not alone. The ghost of a famous bandleader from the 1930s is haunting the youth center, which is located on the spot of the famous old Athena Supper Club. Our mystery teens work with Rev Run to get to the bottom of this mystery, find the legendary golden microphone lost over eighty years ago and get the youth center back up and running.",
