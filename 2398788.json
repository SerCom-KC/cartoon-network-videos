  "description": "Thomas and Percy explore a brand-new track the evening before the route is opened. Everything seems new and exciting, and even a night spent stuck in the mud turns into a wonderful experience. Only in the light of day do they realize that nothing they saw was really \"new\" at all - it just seemed so because they brought to it a sense of delight and discovery.",
