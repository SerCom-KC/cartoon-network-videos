  "description": "Pocoyo and Pato are playing at being terrifying giant monsters, like the sort of monsters they've seen in their comics. They find a toy city and enjoy being like Godzilla and King Kong. They don't notice that the little toys who live in the city are scared and that they're all running away in terror as Pocoyo and Pato destroy their toy city. The audience tells Pocoyo and Pato to stop. Once Pocoyo and Pato realize what's been going on they repair the damage and make a wonderful funfair for the little toys.",
