  "description": "Puppycorn is sick of Unikitty always helping him out and doesn't want to be the \"little\" brother anymore, so he uses some of Dr Fox's 'grow taffy' to grow literally bigger than Unikitty. Meanwhile, a black hole is on its way to destroy the planet. But when Puppycorn takes too much and continues growing, he starts accidentally destroying the kingdom. Unikitty takes grow taffy and grows big as well to help out, but when they're both the size of planets, Puppycorn proves he can take care of himself on his own by destroying the black hole and saving the kingdom.",
