  "description": "The Wattersons set off on a relaxing vacation and end up running for their lives! The Wattersons are swapping scary stories on a family vacation, when their car breaks down in the middle of the desert. They are left with no alternative but to trust a complete stranger, whose appearance matches the scary guy in Mom's story. When the stranger brings them to a derelict gas station, just as he did in mom's made-up scary story, the Wattersons can no longer pretend the story isn't coming true . . .",
