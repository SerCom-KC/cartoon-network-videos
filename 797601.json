  "description": "A long time ago, there was a town called Gatorburg, where gators flowed wild and free and people got rich. Now, it's a ghost town. Gators are all dried up. But when Scooby and the gang receive an imitation Gatorburg purse, they decide to see for themselves if the gators really are gone. Forced to stay overnight when someone steals the engine to the Mystery Machine, they soon discover that gators have indeed returned - only these have comb-overs, walk on two legs and don't like visitors.",
