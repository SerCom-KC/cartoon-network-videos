  "description": "Pato is enjoying watering his flowers when all of a sudden he notices that something smells horrible. It's Loula: she stinks. Elly is putting on perfume, and she too notices how bad Loula smells. Pooey! When Pocoyo can't eat his sandwich because Loula smells so bad, he makes a plan. Loula needs a wash. The only problem is, Loula doesn't want to get in the bath and gives chase to Pocoyo, Elly and Pato. Pocoyo and his friends decide to trick Loula into a cleaning machine but their plan is thwarted. However will they stop the smell? Then, all of a sudden it begins to rain and Loula finally gets her long-awaited clean.",
