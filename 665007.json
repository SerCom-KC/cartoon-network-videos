  "description": "After Ben thinks he's broken Gwen's computer, he sneaks off and enters an \"ultimate wrestling competition\" to win enough money to buy her a new one. On the mat as Fourarms, he becomes an instant celebrity hit with the fans and ends up going up against a tandem of odd looking brothers with special mutant-like powers. Initially adversaries, Ben and the brothers become allies when Ben discovers the brothers are beholden to a powerful mob boss. Ben helps the brothers defeat the mob boss and his henchmen, and in the end realizes Gwen's computer was never really broken.",
