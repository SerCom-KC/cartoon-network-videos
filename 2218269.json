They run \"aground\" in the strange Sargasso Sea full of thick Sargassum seaweed and a graveyard of old ships of all kinds. When sharkmen start attacking the yacht and all on board, it's up to our gang to team up with Cher and get to the bottom of this murky mystery. Can they escape the sharkmen long enough to dive the wrecks below and find the answers they need?",
